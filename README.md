# Mars Rover Explorer
An object-oriented exercise in Javascript.

## Description

NASA has contracted you to develop the Mars Rover's software. You must use object-oriented Javascript to create an `Area` of landing, scattered with `Thing`s that can be either `Finding`s or `Obstacles`. Finally, the `MarsRover` must "land" in a random position in the exlore area and be able to navigate it safely by avoiding obstacles and providin feedback on its findings!

Follow the instructions in the comments in the `index.js` file.

**Expected time to develop: between 2 and 4 hours.**
